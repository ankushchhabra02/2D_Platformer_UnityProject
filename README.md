# 2D_Platformer_UnityProject

Lost In Space is basically a 2D Platformer Game 

Changes that I have made will be visible to you by Playing Game

Some of the Changes are--

I have changed the look and feel of the main menu.

I have designed the level of my game and added various components by exploring prefabs and art asset

As you play the game difficulty level will also increase.

Although it has one level but i have tried hard to make that level interesting.
